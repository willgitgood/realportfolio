                Tech enthusiast with a penchant for entertainment, I find my balance between the riveting stories of Marvel movies and the virtual realms of my PS5 adventures. Two years into my coding journey, I've been immersed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, sculpting digital experiences that blend creativity and functionality.

Currently, I'm laser-focused on achieving my CCNA certification by November 2024, diving into the intricate world of networking. For the past six years, I've tackled technical user troubleshooting across NMCI networks and standalone systems, refining my problem-solving skills.

My world revolves around technology. It's not just a jobâ€”it's a passion that fuels my drive to learn endlessly. From gaming consoles to coding languages, I'm a dedicated lifelong learner, eager to stay ahead in this ever-evolving tech landscape.
